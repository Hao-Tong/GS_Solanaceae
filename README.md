# GS_Solanaceae
Genomic prediction of morphometric and colorimetric traits in Solanaceous fruits

# 1. Description of the main folder
pepper: GS in pepper accessions

tomato: GS in tomato accessions

tomato_wild_A: GS in wild tomato accessions of scenario A

tomato_wild_B: GS in wild tomato accessions of scenario B

# 2. Raw data
There is one subfolder named "data" which includes all raw data (SNPs, TA and CD traits and corresponding groups).

The subfolder "fold" contains the cross-validation scenario data. 

The subfolder "tag" contains the selected tag SNP of each scenario (in zip file) and tag SNP number in each chromosome.  

# 3. Code and results
For sigle-trait GS model, i.e. rrBLUP, RF, SVC, as well as multi-trait GS model (MT), the folder includes all codes and results used in this study. 

Noted that the folder "rrBLUP_CD" is the one calculated the accracy based on the same quantile of CD trait.
